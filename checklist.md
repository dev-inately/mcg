- [x] Prepare submission email

## Database Schema Overview

```
Users (id, name, wallet_balance, created_at, updated_at)
ProductCategories (id, name, description, created_at, updated_at)
Products (id, name, price, category_id, created_at, updated_at)
Plans (id, user_id, product_id, quantity, total_amount, created_at, updated_at)
PendingPolicies (id, plan_id, status, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at)
Policies (id, pending_policy_id, user_id, plan_id, policy_number, created_at, updated_at)
```

## Key Business Rules to Implement
1. **Wallet Management**: Deduct total amount based on quantity √ó product price
2. **Pending Policy Creation**: Create slots equal to purchased quantity
3. **Policy Activation**: Generate unique policy numbers and soft delete pending policies
4. **User Policy Limit**: Maximum one policy per user per plan
5. **Soft Delete**: Pending policies are soft deleted when activated

## Product Specifications
### Health Products
- **Optimal Care Mini**: ‚Ç¶10,000 per unit
- **Optimal Care Standard**: ‚Ç¶20,000 per unit

### Auto Products
- **Third-Party**: ‚Ç¶5,000 per unit
- **Comprehensive**: ‚Ç¶15,000 per unit

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [x] Fetch various products with associated product category and price
- [x] Buy a plan with wallet deduction based on quantity
- [x] View list of pending policies under a plan
- [x] Activate pending policies (soft delete on activation)
- [x] View all activated policies with plan filtering
- [x] Ensure user has only one policy per plan

## Technical Requirements
- [x] Well-thought-out entity relationships
- [x] No authentication API (use seeding for user data)
- [x] Unit or integration tests
- [x] GitHub public repository
- [x] Detailed README with testing instructions

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1-2**: 1-2 days (Setup & Database)
- **Phase 3-4**: 2-3 days (Core Logic & APIs)
- **Phase 5**: 1 day (Validation & Rules)
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 days (Testing)
- **Phase 7-8**: 1 day (Documentation & Final Review)

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-9 days

## Submission Deadline
**Latest by 29th August, 2025 by 5PM**
